            The user is greated with a very generic welcome screen. On the right side of the screen, the users have the option of signing in or registering for our service. If the user wishes to remain a guest, they have access to one of the many tutorial services that we offer. Upon clicking 'View Tutorials' or 'Login' (providing the user has the correct credentials) the program takes the user to the main tutorial navigation page. After a professor logs in they are sent to this screen.

        <p>The 'Home', 'Progress', and 'Login' are just buttons that are clickable. The 'Tutorials', 'Quizzes', and 'Chat' have dual functionality, if they are just clicked they take the user to a landing page for each of those. If the button is hovered over, a dropdown appears.</p>

        <p>When an instructor clicks on 'Home' it takes them to the <a href="manager.html">High Level Manager</a>. If Progress is clicked it takes the instructor to the <a href="progress2.html">progress page</a>.</p>

        <p>If a user is not logged in then Login appears in the menu and clicking it takes them to the <a href="login.html">login page</a>. If however a user is logged in then then 'Login' is replaced with Logout which logs the user out.</p>

        <p>When an instructor hovers over 'Tutorials' they see 2 subcategories, 'My Tutorials' and 'Create Tutorial' as seen in the diagram below. If they click on the 'My Tutorials' option it takes them to a page that has all of the tutorials that they are an author of. If they click the 'Create Tutorial' option it opens up the Tutorial Builder.</p>
