            The user will be greated with a very generic welcome screen. On the right side of the screen, we will give our users a the option of signing in or registering for our service. If the user wishes to remain a guest, they will have access to one of the many tutorial services that we offer. Upon clicking "View Tutorials" or "Login" (providing you have the correct credentials) it will take you to the main tutorial navigation page. After a professor logs in they will be sent to this screen.

        <p>When an instructor clicks on Home it will take them to the <a href="manager.html">High Level Manager</a>. If Progress is clicked it will take the instructor to the <a href="progress2.html">progress page</a>.</p>

        <p>If a user is not logged in then Login will appear in the menu and clicking it will take them to the <a href="login.html">login page</a>. If however a user is logged in then then Login will be replace with Logout which will log the user out.</p>
