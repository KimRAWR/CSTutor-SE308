   <h1><center>Quiz</center></h1>
   <p class = "quizT"> The CS Tutor is a tool that is made to help students understand topics better for their respective classes. This section particularly consists of sample quiz taken by the student and a sample quiz the professor can design.</p>
   <p> An example of a CS Tutor quiz will look like this:</p>
   <p><img src = "Quiz1.jpg"> </p>
   <p> For this quiz, the student fills in the answer. The student can then click onto the next page and continues to finish the quiz.</p>
   <p> Now, let's say if the student want to submit the quiz, it will look something like this: </p>
   <p><img src = "Submit.jpg"> </p>
   <p> For the teacher, the quiz will look a bit different because the teacher will be responsible for editing the quiz. A sample of a quiz edited by the instructor will look like this: </p>
   <p><img src = "quiz2.jpg"> </p> 
   <p> Let's say if the instructor wants to edit a quiz from another class, he/she can selector other class sections on the menu box right of the questions. Otherwise, once the quiz is done editing, the instructor can save it.</p>
